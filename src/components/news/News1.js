          <p class="mb-2 p-2 lead leading-relaxed">The University of Santo
Tomas administration has
held the groundbreaking
ceremonies for the UST-Dr. Tony Tan
Caktiong Innovation Center, the second
structure to rise in the UST Sta. Rosa
Campus.
          Named after one of the most
celebrated entrepreneurs of the country,
Jollibee Foods Corporation founder
and Chemical Engineering alumnus
Dr. Tony Tan Caktiong, the innovation
center will be the hub of discoveries and
inventions in new home of Thomasians
in Southern Luzon. 
          The structure, which is expected
to be operational by the first quarter of
2022, was made possible through the
generous donation of Tan Caktiong to
the UST Research and Endowment
Foundation, Inc</p>

          <p class="mb-2 p-2 lead leading-relaxed">Vice Rector Fr. Isaias D. Tiongco,
OP, said that consistent with the vision
of the UST Sta. Rosa campus, the
new innovation center will be a step
in the right direction toward the goal
of bringing Thomasian education to a
greater number of Filipinos.
The center, Tiongco said,
will help UST to be “ready to meet
challenges brought about by changing
tides in education.”
“UST cannot afford to stay put
and be content with the way things are.
We have to traverse similar trajectories
as our counterparts abroad and even go
beyond parameters to make education
similar to new models, if not more
advanced,” he added.</p>
<p>
The Vice Rector for Research
and Innovation, Maribel G. Nonato,
said that the new innovation center will
be “bringing research back to society,”
which is among the advocacies of Fr.
Herminio V. Dagohoy, OP. 
“In 2019, we launched the
DOST-TomasINNO Center, which
is a smaller version of the center we
will have here. This is a good first step
in making the UST Sta. Rosa UST’s
innovation-driven campus.” Nonato also hailed the project as
a good example of alumni partnerships
that UST has, calling the center as “a
Thomasian leader’s dream fulfilled by a
Thomasian alumnus’s aspirations.”
</p>

<p><br/>
Jollibee Foods Corporation
Chairman, Dr. Tony Tan Caktiong, said
that the innovation center recognizes
the critical role that innovation plays
in economic growth, which should be
“smart, inclusive, and sustainable.” 
Reflecting on his own journey as
an entrepreneur, Tan Caktiong said that
“some of the most important lessons
were learned through failures,” which
he recognized as inevitable but should
never deter the Thomasian community
from achieving our collective goal of
embodying the Thomasian core values.
The three-storey structure was
designed by Casas+ Architects, whose
CEO, Ar. Carmelo Casas, said that
the design’s philosophy paid homage
to UST’s timelessness. As such, the
building, which will use state-of-theart technology and materials, will be
a flexible edifice whose features are
adaptable and sustainable.
