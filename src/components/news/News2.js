Philosophy that was held
at the Martyrs’ Hall at the
Ecclesiastical Faculties, UST on March
7 and 8, 2019 was significant in more
ways than one. The conference, held in
commemoration of the 475th Death
Anniversary of Saint Thomas Aquinas,
was the first conference organized by
the Faculty of Philosophy Students’
Forum (FPSF) on the topic. It was also
within this conference that the Gerardo
Rocha- Universidad Santo Tomás Chile
Professorial Chair in Ecclesiastical
Studies and Bioethics for Academic
Year 2018-2019 was awarded.</p>

          <p class="mb-2 p-2 lead leading-relaxed">Fr. Michael Mascari, O.P., the
former Socius to the Master of the
Order of Preachers for the Intellectual
Life and currently the Academic Dean
of Aquinas Institute of Theology in
Saint Louis, Missouri, USA, received
the award from UST Vice Rector and
Faculty of Philosophy Dean Rev. Fr.
Richard G. Ang, O.P., Ph.D., and UST
Secretary General Rev. Fr. Jesús M.
Miranda, Jr., O.P., Ph.D.
This was the first time that the
Gerardo Rocha-UST Chile Professorial
Chair in Ecclesiastical Studies was
awarded in the University. The Gerardo
Rocha-Universidad Santo Tomás Professorial Chair in Ecclesiastical
Studies and Bioethics was endowed
by Gerardo Rocha Vera in 2001 in
the UST Research and Endowment
Foundation, Inc. The donor was
Founder-President of the UST Chile,
and Co-Founder of the International
Council of Universities of Saint
Thomas Aquinas, which is now known
as the ICUSTA.</p>
<p>
The late Dr. Rocha, who was an
honorary consul of the Philippines in
Chile, had once served as Director
of the Chile-Russia Chamber of
Commerce. He was member of Spain’s
Fraternity of Crusaders of Mary, and
an active participant in international
gatherings, such as the Catholic
Congress on Public Life in Madrid
and the Inter-Religious Encounters in
Barcelona.
Meanwhile, his brainchild, the
ICUSTA is an international association
of Catholic institutions of higher
learning that faithfully adhere to the
ideals and teachings of the Angelic
Doctor St. Thomas Aquinas. The
main purpose of the international
organization is to encourage
cooperation and collaboration, and
international understanding among its
members.
</p>

<p><br/>
Since 1995, after its convention
at the University of St. Thomas in
Houston, Texas, the ICUSTA has
expanded its membership to 29
institutions from Argentina, Australia,
Canada, Chile, Ethiopia, France,
Ireland, Italy, Mozambique, South
Sudan, Spain, Taiwan, the United
States of America, Zimbabwe, and the
Philippines.
It has had biennial meetings
that had been held in host institutions
across continents. To note, two
international ICUSTA meetings have
been held at the University of Santo
Tomas, Manila: first, in 1997, and
second during the Quadricentennial
celebration in 2011.
